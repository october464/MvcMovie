# MvcMovie database lab
#### I followed a tutorial to build this solution which was written by Rick Anderson. The tutorial can be viewed on the Microsoft site [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/?view=aspnetcore-3.1). This tutorial is designed to help in the understanding of developing web apps using ASP.NET CORE MVC. By using this tutorial as a guideline I have become more filmilar on the basics on using MVC to crerate controllers, views and models. With the basics I was able to make a database that manages and displays a list of movies that show the title, genre, release date, price and ratings for each movie. Thanks for viewing my readme section.
